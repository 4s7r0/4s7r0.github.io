  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  <br>
  <h2>How To Help:</h2>
  <p>We are Alvie, Alexander, and Adam. If you are reading this, it's likely that we are neighbors! Hello, neighbor! Unless you've come here from a link someone shared, in which case, Hello, rando! Anyway, I wanted to take some time out of my busy day to help communicate some things to the people calling the police to complain, or who drive by taking photos while screaming at us.</p>
  <br>
  <p>First, thank you to everyone who has helped us and continues to support us. We are working hard every single day to become sheltered and mobile, ultimately, leaving this location permanently.</p>
  <p>To those of you who are working against us, I cannot make you care about other people. But what I will share with you is that the system is broken and we refuse to pretend that it is not. We will succeed in making a better life for ourselves, with or without your help.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Two of us are autistic, but only one of us is Federally recognized and receiving assistance.</p>
  <br>
  <p>If you'd like to help, you can donate cash to us directly, we are <a href="http://venmo.com/ox-en">@ox-en</a> on Venmo, or go to <a href="http://UgiftABLE.com">UgiftABLE.com</a>.

  <p>I am doing my best and cannot promise anything, but I will try and update this page as things change. Check regularly, if interested.</p>
